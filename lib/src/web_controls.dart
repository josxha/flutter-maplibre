/// A `GeolocateControl` control provides a button that uses the browser's

/// sites to be served over HTTPS. If geolocation support is not available,
/// the `GeolocateControl` will show as disabled.
///
/// The zoom level applied will depend on the accuracy of the geolocation
/// provided by the device.
///
/// The `GeolocateControl` has two modes. If `trackUserLocation` is `false`
/// (default) the control acts as a button, which when pressed will set the
/// map's camera to target the user location. If the user moves, the map won't
/// update. This is most suited for the desktop. If `trackUserLocation` is
/// `true` the control acts as a toggle button that when active the user's
/// location is actively monitored for changes. In this mode the
/// `GeolocateControl` has three interaction states:
/// * active - the map's camera automatically updates as the user's location
///   changes, keeping the location dot in the center. Initial state and upon
///   clicking the `GeolocateControl` button.
/// * passive - the user's location dot automatically updates, but the map's
///   camera does not. Occurs upon the user initiating a map movement.
/// * disabled - occurs if Geolocation is not available, disabled or denied.
///
/// These interaction states can't be controlled programmatically, rather they
/// are set based on user interactions.
