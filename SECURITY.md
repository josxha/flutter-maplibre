# Security Policy

## Acceptable Use

We generally invite security researchers to search for vulnerabilities
in our services. We kindly ask to not put any actual user data or
production systems at risk.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Report vulnerabilities via e-mail to <info@joscha-eckert.de>. We do not
offer a GPG key for encryption.

Please make sure that you include the following information:

- Which version is affected
- How can the bug be used/exploited
- Explanation of the risk

If you have not received an answer within a couple of days, feel free
to contact us again.

For used open source software, we recommend to file bug reports and/or
pull requests against the upstream repositories. This includes hardening
instructions in the installation documentation.
