This package provides unofficial Flutter bindings for MapLibre SDKs.

- [maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) is used for web
- [maplibre-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native) (previously
  named maplibre-gl) is used for android and in the future for iOS,
  windows, macOS and Linux

MapLibre is a permissive and open source solution for the MVT 
(Mapbox Vector Tile) standard. By binding to native SDKs the package 
accomplishes performant rendering while supporting a lot of complex 
functionality.

### State of Implementation

functionality. [See our documentation to learn more.](https://flutter-maplibre.pages.dev/docs/features/supported-features)

## Development & Contributing

If you need a feature or experience a bug you want to fix contributions are
welcome.

#### Run Code Generation

We use code generation from [pigeon](https://pub.dev/packages/pigeon). 
If you change the file [pigeons/pigeon.dart](pigeons/pigeon.dart) you'll have
to run the code generator.
Use the generator script (or run the commands yourself) to generate the code.

On unix systems (macos, linux):
```bash
./pigeon/run.sh
```

On windows systems:

```powershell
.\pigeon\run.sh
```


#### Test with WebAssembly

This package supports WebAssembly builds! ðŸ¥³

```bash
flutter pub global activate dhttpd # only once
cd example
flutter build web --wasm
dhttpd '--headers=Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy=credentialless;Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy=same-origin' --path=build/web
```

or follow
the [flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/wasm#serving-wasm-locally)
