# Overview

This is the documentation for the MapLibre on Flutter.
The [maplibre](https://pub.dev/packages/maplibre) package provides bindings to
MapLibre Native and MapLibre-GL-JS.

Here is an overview what you can find in this documentation:

- [Getting started](../getting-started/add-dependency) helps you to integrate the
  package into your project.
- [Styles](../styles) can be used to customize the design of the map.
- [Annotations](../category/annotations) are an easy way to add Markers, Circles,
  Polylines or Polygons to the map.
- [Layers](../category/layers) are a powerful way to add or remove new layers to
  the map.
- [Events](../events) are a way to listen to something like a click on the map.
