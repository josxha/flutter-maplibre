# Overview

This is the documentation for the MapLibre on Flutter.
The [maplibre](https://pub.dev/packages/maplibre) package provides bindings to
MapLibre Native and MapLibre-GL-JS.

Here is an overview what you can find in this documentation:

- [Getting started](../getting-started/add-dependency) helps you to integrate
  the
  package into your project.
- [Styles](../styles) can be used to customize the design of the map.
- [User Interface](../ui) provides easy to use controls and indicators.
- [Layers](../category/layers) are an easy way to add annotations such as
  Markers, Circles, Polylines or Polygons to the map.
- [Style Layers](../category/style-layers) are a powerful way to add or remove
  new layers to the map.
- [Events](../events) are a way to listen to something like a click on the map.
