# Add Dependency

Add `maplibre` to your project by running this command:

```bash
flutter pub add maplibre
```

or add it directly as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file and run 
`flutter pub get`:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  # highlight-next-line
  maplibre: ^0.0.1 # use the latest version found on pub.dev
```

You can find the latest version of the package on
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/maplibre) or here:
