# Upgrade from version 0.0.x

Version `0.1.0` introduced some breaking changes. This site will guide you
through all of them.

## General Information on Breaking Changes

We are using
the [pub.dev version convention](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning) for the
package.

While the package is prior its
`1.0.0` release, every minor `0.x.0` release can introduce breaking changes.

> Although semantic versioning doesn't promise any compatibility between
> versions prior to 1.0.0, the Dart community convention is to treat those
> versions semantically as well. The interpretation of each number is just
> shifted
> down one slot: going from 0.1.2 to 0.2.0 indicates a breaking change, going to
> 0.1.3 indicates a new feature, and going to 0.1.2+1 indicates a change that
> doesn't affect the public API.
