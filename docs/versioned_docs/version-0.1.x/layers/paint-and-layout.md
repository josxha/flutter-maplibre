# Paint & Layout Properties

While the [AnnotationLayers](../category/layers) can only use simple values for its
annotations, [Layers](../category/layers) can use the powerful paint and layout
properties. See
the [MapLibre Style Specification](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/layers)
for all available properties for the different layers.

In addition, you can
use [Expressions](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/expressions/) that
supports transitions, zoom level dependent styling and much more.

Creating these maps can be a bit tricky. We recommend to build and test your
paint and layout properties in [Maputnik](https://maplibre.org/maputnik) first
and copy it over.
